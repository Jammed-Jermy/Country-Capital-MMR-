    The program initially has a set of known country-capital pairs in the "main.csv" file.

    When the user interacts with the program and provides new country-capital information in response to the program's prompts, this new data is added to the "probable.csv" file.

    Based on user feedback and interactions, the program may promote certain pairs from the "probable.csv" file to the "main.csv" file, effectively considering them as newly learned pairs.

    The program's knowledge base in the "main.csv" file grows over time as more correct pairs are added.
